# Coding challenge #

The enclosed `survey.json` contains a simplified output of our survey-api.


Goal #1 is to mimic the layout you can see in `project_layout.png` by using the data provided in the json-file.

Goal #2 is to add functionality to the `Weiter` button, so the question of page 2 gets shown. The button gets its caption from the value of `page_next_text` in the json-file.

Goal #3 is to switch the caption of the `Weiter` button to the the value you find in the json for `complete_text`

Goal #4 is to add a final page where you show the texts you find in `completed_heading` & `completed_text`. The styling should roughly match the first page.
